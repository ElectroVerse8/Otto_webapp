1. Install the ESP8266 board package in the Arduino IDE.
2. Install required libraries listed in README.md.
3. Copy this folder to your Arduino sketchbook and open `src/otto_webapp.ino`.
4. Upload the files in the `data/` directory to LittleFS using the "ESP8266 Sketch Data Upload" tool.
5. Compile and upload the sketch to the ESP8266.
